# Just 2 Things To Make Your Life Even Easier And More Enjoy Your Journey

- First and foremost, Minecraft is a game of achievements where you can do anything you want. While there isn't a specific goal, players often focus on collecting a wide variety of items by exploring the worlds, killing all bosses, building a house, constructing machines, and progressing from manual to automated processes,... etc, just do what you like, my spear is already level 50 so I'm building an aquarium and collecting all the fishes in the worlds right now.
 
- And secondly, you can find almost **anything** you want in the item suggestions, try to search for anything you want and just **CLICK** on the item you want, It'll show many categories you can choose to see how to craft the item, how to find the item, how to repair the item,...

![everything about an item](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/35d352b53f969b0f735b752f6ec83a6b11168a65_0.webp)


**Useful informations:**
- You can pick up blocks, creatures,... (Shift + Right Click)
- Craft a Pocket GPS to show the Minimap
- Press "L" to show all the achievements, pretty useful
- Press "+" to add a waypoint, press "Y" to open waypoint list
- You can reset your Golem's home radius or behaviors,... by making a "Golem Controller", this is kind of complicated, hold the "Golem Controller" in your hand, **SHIFT-RIGHT CLICK, DON'T CLICK TO YOUR GOLEM**, every time you **SHIFT-RIGHT CLICK** it'll change the mode of the "Golem Controller", change to **Home** then **LEFT-CLICK TO THE GOLEM YOU WANNA CHANGE**, after that **RIGHT-CLICK** to the block you want the Golem will patrol around...
- Staff of Suppression, stop mobs from spawning 64 blocks around
- Pocket GPS, shows minimap
- Hostile mobs can't break iron bars, iron blocks, diamond blocks,...



<details>
<summary>Secrets</summary>
  
- Beds have a chance to explode, it can be reduced by having a friend sleeping right next to you, holding a flower, near a campfire, and the best is having a luck effect.
- Mobs are stronger by the time you play but they can also get stronger when there's a mysterious lightning strike at them, the lightning gives them a buff and if they already had the buff, it'll increase the buff level.
- Punching blocks while holding an item decreases 50% of damage dealt by that block.
- Can craft oak planks by using 4 sticks.
- There's sometimes a minion hiding below the sand, which be noticed by some sand particles, breaking the sand block and the minion will show up to give you some items.
- many more...
